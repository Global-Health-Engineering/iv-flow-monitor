# Dripito – Pediatric IV Flow Rate Monitor

This repository contains the firmware and altium files for the development of **Dripito**, a pediatric IV flow rate monitor designed for humanitarian and low-resource settings.

## Project Overview

Dripito is developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis at ETH Zurich in collaboration with the Global Health Engineering group. The project aims to create a reliable, low-cost device capable of accurately detecting IV flow rates using drop sensing and IR technology.

## Structure
- `/drive/` — Written thesis, presentations, images, videos, and supplementary project information 
- `/firmware/` — STM32 firmware source code and configuration (CubeMX `.ioc` file)
- `/hardware/` — PCB schematics, layouts (Altium files), BoM, and stp/stl/3mf files.

## Milestones

- ✅ Schematic and PCB design finalized  
- ✅ Initial firmware structure and button interface  
- ✅ Basic drop sensing and IR LED control  
- ✅ Full system integration and casing assembly  
- ✅ Calibration and experimental validation
- ✅ Presentation
- ✅ Final documentation and ETH submission
